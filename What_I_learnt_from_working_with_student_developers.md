# What I learned from working with students and how it’s positively changed our team

## Background
Through the 2017 calendar year my teams at the Hesburgh Library, University of Notre Dame worked with 4 undergrad students at ND in a 'student developer program'. 3 were part time over the Spring'17 semester and 1 was in a fully immersed 13 week internship over Summer'17.  

The initial intent was to help a couple students learn about quality assurance, testing and automation which they could then use to help us assess our websites. I have to say, we mutually gained so much more than we thought.

## Why engage with students?
I consider students as a very powerful group of people: they are hungry for knowledge, inquisitive and want to learn just about anything that is even remotely interesting to them.

## Where students saw the value:
* We positioned the roles as ‘student developers’ instead of ‘student workers’, and that made a huge impact. It affirmed the belief in students that we are invested in their growth and we value them in the team like any other member.
* They looked at this as an opportunity to learn new skills, understand the dynamics of working with a full fledged technology team and contribute code to open source repositories. All of which can be great things to mention on their resumes.
* Students saw a lot of value in tying up what they do with the larger picture. It was important for them to understand how their day to day contributions were tying up to the larger goals of the library and the University.

## What worked for the students:
* It was immensely helpful to them when I broke down the tasks to a point that it could be completed in 8-16 hours, anything that took longer needed more learning/exploration and was leading them into a rabbit hole.
* They enjoyed a mix of structured learning and serendipitous exploration to get comfortable in the quality assurance ecosystem.
* We involved them in all discussions, meetings, standups, fun events, potlucks etc. to provide the larger picture and build a strong teamwork mindset. This gave them avenues to understand what else apart from writing code goes into building a product. (i.e. requirements gathering, sprint planning, code reviews, etc.)
* I was seeking frequent feedback (weekly), and always checking if they were enjoying what the experience and if they wanted to learn something else. This gave them an opportunity to not feel like they're stuck in doing a specific type of work.

## What worked for me and my team:
* I personally learnt more by teaching than I could have learnt by self learning. This follows the philosophy that ‘If you can’t explain something in simple english, you have not understood it yourself.’
* This has also had a ripple effect across the team and inculcated a culture of 'Learn to teach someone'.
* It has helped us whet our documentation and clarifying assumptions
* Better documentation has lowered the cost of context switching for other team members to work on different projects
* We have started making a conscious effort improve the process of capturing, describing,  organizing work and most importantly defining what 'done' looks like
* We've made great progress in keeping our momentum and maturing in the quality assurance space.

## Myth: It takes a lot of overhead to mentor and train a student.
I was very surprised to see how quickly a fresh, unbiased mind learns. I needed less than 2-3 weeks of planned coaching to make the students effective and start delivering independently.
