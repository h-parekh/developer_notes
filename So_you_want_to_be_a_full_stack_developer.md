### What's so exciting about Full Stack Development?
This sounds like a know-it-all. Almost like having a super power to build anything.

But is this a new buzzword that's going to fizzle out over time? Or is it going to be the new norm for developers?

Either way, just thinking about the possibilities of being able to build anything blew my mind away. I could not let this be a fleeting thought and so I immersed myself into a few weeks of 'brewing'.

### What does it mean to be a full stack developer?
In plain vanilla flavor, the most commonly understood definition of a full stack developer is a person who can write front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS) and back-end 'server-side' code (PHP, Ruby and Python). Alongside, the developer must have an understanding of storage, web security, quality assurance, software version control, basic algorithms and data structures.

This isn't plain vanilla after all, because knowing and mastering all these things isn't easy in this world of ever evolving technologies. It's not just impossible but also impractical to keep up with everything all the time.

So is it impossible to go full stack if you're a new developer, or have some related experience in either front-end or back-end? Depends how you think about it.

### From an individual standpoint, is Full Stack Development a mindset or a set of skills?
I think its a mindset, this takes the focus away from knowing everything  but knowing enough to be effective. This approach can also be an excellent way to design a career path in professional software development.

### What happens if everyone in a team has this super power of full stack development? (Wishful thinking here)
- Each person has enough technical sophistication to have more informed conversations with others
- Everyone has a better understanding of the impact of their work to other moving parts
- From an organizational standpoint, it lowers the cost of switching talent and resources
- Promotes a learning environment because everyone's vulnerable by admitting not knowing something
