# Purpose
This document helps me collate my thoughts and map progress while solo-developing. It's for personal use only, however I may use it for referencing in remote communication with collaborators.

# What and Why

We don't want to maintain a fork of node-red. We want to use node-red as a npm package and design incrementally workable process for the use cases listed below:
### SR-1
Anyone in share-research should be able to upgrade share-red instance to a newer release of node-red
### SR-2
Allow a developer to build custom nodes and include them in the runtime
### SR-3
Allow a team to iterate over a flow using node-red projects
### SR-4
Build a cloud based runtime (For both editing and running?... tbd)
### SR-5
Use custom settings.js for share-research

# How
There is an existing community using a dockerized version of node-red (although not up-to-date with the latest node-red version). See [node-red-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red-docker/).
We can customize this to address our needs.

Docker has the benefit of easy portability from local development to cloud. [AWS ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html) is designed to build, run, test, and deploy distributed applications using containers.


# Progress

### 2019-01-23
* Ryan added the custom node [share-lower-case](https://www.npmjs.com/package/share-lower-case) to npm, and I was able to add it as a dependency.

### 2019-01-22
* Created new repo [share-red-docker](https://github.com/h-parekh/share-red-docker)
* addresses the full requirement of node-red version upgrade in [SR-1](#sr-1)
* partially addresses [SR-2](#sr-2) by being able to handle custom nodes as dependencies. Needs more testing with 'share-lower-case'
* It also addresses [SR-5](#sr-5).
* Closes https://github.com/share-research/share-red/issues/11

# Running to do:
  1. - [ ] Research spike: Articulate a strategy to maintain docker images, so we don't have to rebuild everytime
  2. - [ ] Make decision: Decide on a naming convention for share-research custom nodes. [node-red documentation](https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/packaging) doesn't mandate prefixes, so we could use `share-` prefix.
  ```
Node modules should use node-red-contrib- as a prefix to their name to make it clear they are not maintained by the Node-RED project. Alternatively, any name that doesnâ€™t use node-red as a prefix can be used.
  ```
  3. - [ ] Make decision: What repo structure should we have for the different custom nodes? Options are:
      1. Simplest way, we maintain separate repos for each custom node. Need to make sure the same static files are used across the repos for design consistency.
      2. Alternatively, keep a monorepo so static content like icons can be shared. Can they be published as one package if they nodes are all sub modules in the monorepo?
  4. - [ ] Discuss use case: Do we want users to be able to collaborate over editing workflows in the cloud instance?
  5. - [ ] Research spike: Research data [mounting strategy](https://docs.docker.com/storage/) in Docker. Helps determine workflow for [SR-3](#sr-3)
